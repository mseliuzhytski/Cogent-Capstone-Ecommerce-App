#### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed for frontend development.
- MySQL database set up locally for local usage.

#### Steps

1. **Clone Repositories:**
- Clone The following Repositories:
	- Main Service (Current Repository)
	- [Server Repository](https://github.com/mseliuzhytski/Cogent-Capstone-Ecommerce-Service-Registry)
	- [Gateway Repository](https://github.com/mseliuzhytski/Cogent-Capstone-Ecommerce-Gateway)
	- [Sales Report Service Repository](https://github.com/mseliuzhytski/Cogent-Capstone-Ecommerce-Sales-Report)
	- [Discount Service Repository](https://github.com/mseliuzhytski/Cogent-Capstone-Ecommerce-Discounts)
	- [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/mseliuzhytski/Cogent-Capstone-Ecommerce-Frontend)

2. **Setup Local MySQL Database:**
- On the Main Service, Discount Service, and Sales Report Service Spring Boot applications, go to application properties under the resources folder
- Configure your local MySQL database with the correct credentials (username, password, URL)
  - You will set your database details on the fields: (spring.datasource)
  - For example: For your username: **spring.datasource.username=yourusername**
  - *Note: You should remove previous database configurations, only one set of database properties should be present*
- Ensure on first launch that you have these properties: **spring.sql.init.mode=always**
- On Subsequent Launches make sure the property is set to none: **spring.sql.init.mode=none**
- If you want to use some user-provided data including an administrator username and password (specified in application.properties), then issue the POST request: localhost:8080/databaseloader

3. **Run Spring Boot Applications:**
- Run the Server Spring Boot application first, followed by the Gateway Spring Boot application, and then the remaining Spring Boot applications.

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
- Navigate to the Frontend Repository directory.
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

5. **Serve Angular Project:**
- Run `ng serve` in the Frontend Repository directory to serve the Angular project in development mode.
- Ensure that the Angular project is configured to use the correct service URLs for communication with the backend services.

6. **Access the Application:**
- Once all services are up and running, you should be able to access and fully utilize the application. You can access the application on the port mentioned on the angular application.
